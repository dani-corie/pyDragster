# pyDragster

This is a Proof-of-Concept tap-and-drag fast type keyboard for iOS Pythonista3. It is inspired by the [Thumb-Key input method](https://github.com/dessalines/thumb-key) for Android, created by [Dessalines](https://mastodon.social/@dessalines).

The Pythonista 3 application offers a programmable 3rd party keyboard on iOS. The original goal of this project is to provide a tap-and-drag extension for this keyboard. It may also become the basis of Python implementations for such input methods for open source embedded gadgets in the future; with this goal in mind, I try to keep the GUI code isolated as much as possible.
